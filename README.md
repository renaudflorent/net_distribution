Overview of the Script:

This script is designed to:

1. Describe the evolution of population after survey operations.
2. Classify households (HH) into four categories based on the number of residents:
        -HH with 1 to 2 persons
        -HH with 3 to 4 persons
        -HH with 5 to 6 persons
        -HH with more than 7 persons

Initially, these types of HH are expected to receive 1, 2, 3, and 4 mosquito nets, respectively.

3. Handle the insufficiency of nets: After the survey, the total number of HH increased, leading to an insufficient supply of mosquito nets for all households.

4. Adjust the parameters: It is important to note that while the number of households cannot be changed, the quantity of nets provided to each type of household can be adjusted.

Key Considerations for Adjustment:

  1. District Selection for Adjustment: Identify which districts should be included in the adjustments and the criteria for their selection.

  2. Net Quantity Adjustments: Determine how to modify the number of nets for the selected districts.

Simulation Scenario:

To address the issue, a scenario simulation is created. The simulation considers two main parameters for determining which districts to include:

  * Population growth rate
  * Mosquito net demand growth
  * Or a combination of both

Setting the Minimum Acceptable Value:

The minimum acceptable value for these parameters needs to be defined. Districts that meet or exceed these values will be targeted for adjustments in the number of nets allocated to each HH category.

Example:

Suppose the parameter chosen is the population growth rate with a minimum threshold of 10%. Districts exceeding this threshold will have their net allocation adjusted. For instance, net allocation could change as follows: 1, 2, 2, 3.

Monitoring Net Coverage:

While adjusting the values, it is crucial to monitor the net coverage ratio, which should ideally remain around 1.8 (Mean: 1 net for every 1.8 persons). Deviation from this value will lead to poorer results and reduced efficacy in reducing malaria incidence.

Decision-Making and Stakeholder Involvement:

A decision must be made, and all stakeholders can participate in a voting system. The data will be submitted and stored in a remote PostgreSQL database (RENDER).
